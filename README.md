## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am improving my planning process for building and styling components, especially with flexbox, the more I do it. SVG images have always been a challenge for me, but I love how crisp they look compared to raster images.

A mixins stylesheet should come standard in future projects. They organize styles and declutter the working style.scss file.
